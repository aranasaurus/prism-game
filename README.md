==========

This project began as an entry for [LD31](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/), though it was not at a playable state 
in time to be submitted to the compo or the jam. But I liked the game idea and had a good start so I ran with it and am
continuing development on it to see where it ends up!

Created using [Löve2d](http://love2d.org). Check their [Getting Started](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) guide
for instructions on getting the game running on your platform.

The game is best played with a Gamepad, standard twin-stick controls for moving and shooting, the R1/L1 buttons change the
shield and ship colors. There are keyboard controls, 'wasd' does movement, left/right arrows do rotation, up fires, down 
flips the ship 180º 'q' and 'e' change ship and shield colors.
